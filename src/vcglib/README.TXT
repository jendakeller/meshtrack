The VCGLIB library is released under the GPL license, 
and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual Computing Lab of 
the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI (http://vcg.isti.cnr.it)

Get the latest version here:
http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~cignoni/newvcglib/html/install.html

Go see Meshlab code (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) which demonstrate all 
the features in vcg lib.

VCG lib core is composed only with headers.
So no need to worry about compiling the lib.
Just include the file you need inside the project.

Note: Not all components of vcglib are here because
we don't need all of them for poisson disk sampling

If you add the missing modules of the vcg library:
    - be sure to fetch the same revision (or ovewrite everything in this folder).
    - check if anything need to be compiled.
